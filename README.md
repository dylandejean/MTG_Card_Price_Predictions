# MTG Card Price Predictions

In this project, prices of cards from the game Magic the Gathering will be predicted based on a model trained on characteristics of cards that have been released prior.



## Methods

Using the characteristics of old Magic the Gathering cards and their prices, ridge regression using cross validation will be utilized to create models to predict prices of future cards. 

Variable selection will be an imporant part of the model building process in order to make the ridge regression as accurate as it can be. 

Final predictions can be found in /project/volume/data/processed/submit_ridge.csv

run_project.R executes all code in the repository to make predictions.
